# Rechner
A little calculator I made two years ago.

First project made in C++ a while ago, I didn't use any object-orientated concepts, just coded without thinking too much.
Most of the time I worked on making the user-input fail-safe.

What I learned: How to use Google and Stackoverflow to get the answers to my questions.
